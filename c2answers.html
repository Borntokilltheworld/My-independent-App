    <h1>Answer the following</h1>
</center>
<h2>1.Biotic Environment-The world of living organisms is called biotic – Example: Plants, Animals and human beings.

    g. The gravitational force of the earth holds the atmosphere together. The atmosphere protects us from the harmful rays and heat of the sun. It consist of number of gases, dust and water vapour.
    h. The changes in the atmosphere affects the weather and climate.
    i. Biosphere is the interaction of the three zones hydrosphere, lithosphere and atmosphere.
    j. It is a small zone of interaction where living things exists.</h2>
    <h2>3.1:· Plants and animals depend on each other for their own sake.
 · Plants release oxygen which animals breathe and animals give out carbon di oxide which is needed by plants for photosynthesis.
    · Plants also provide shelter and food for animals.
        · Both are interdependent.</h2>
        <h2>3.2:Early man led a simple life and fulfilled his needs from the nature around him.
